If possible, could we clean up some of these folders?
Only one's that I'm currently using are:
Editor (these have scripts that allow me to view the changes I make while in editor mode, not play)
Images (this has the clouds asset along with the main menu background image)
Imports (if i get anything online, i'll put it in this folder. I have the tree so far)
Materials
Prefabs
Scenes
Scripts
Settings (this is holding the URP settings to make the scene run)
Sounds (this has the audio i put as temp along with the mixers)
TextMeshPro (unity package)
